### Contribute

Vector formats are preferred, if possible. Just submit a pull request with your creation or derivative work! Your contributions will fall under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) license.

**Before submitting a PR, here's some tips:**

- Files are organized into folders by type. If a folder for your file type doesn't already exist, you may create it.
- Each folder should have a plain-text file called `README`. It credits each file in alphabetical order in this general format:
```
