golang-graphics
================

A community repository for Go language vector (and bitmap) graphics. It includes the official graphics that ship with Go as well as 3rd-party contributions.

This is an *unofficial* repository.

The goal of this repository is to encourage creativity and innovation (as well as fair use) in the Go community. Having access to high-quality vector graphics and 3D models makes it possible to produce beautiful, creative works that feel familiar and recognizable.



## How to Contribute

Just submit a pull request with your creation or derivative work. Vector formats are preferred.

**Here's some tips for submitting a PR:**

- Files are organized into folders by type. If a folder for your file type doesn't already exist, you may create it.
- Each folder should have a plain-text file called `README`. It credits each file in alphabetical order in this kind of format (flexible depending on the contribution):
```
file-name.ext
	Contributed by Your Name
	If released under a different license, specify it here
	Adaptation of original-file.png (Original Creator)
	Any other source or historical information of interest
```
- If possible, please try to keep file names lowercase with hyphens between words (no spaces or other punctuation).



## Check the license!

[![CC-BY-4.0](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)

By default, contributions fall under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). However, licenses vary among different files, so pay attention before you use.


#### Is a license specified for that file in the README?

Each folder has a file called `README` that contains information about its contents. If a certain file has an exceptional license, it will be specified in the `README`.



#### Is there a LICENSE file in the folder?

If a folder has a `LICENSE` file, that license applies, by default, to all files in that folder and all sub-folders. It may be overridden by subsequent `LICENSE` files or on a per-file basis in a `README`.
